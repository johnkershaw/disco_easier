<p><span class='perception'>PERCEPTION</span> <span class='check'></span> - You stir to consciousness sprawled upon the ground. It’s cool and gritty against your cheek, and the air smells faintly of dust and ozone.</p>

<p><span class='savoirfaire'>SAVOIR FAIRE</span> <span class='check'></span> - As you push yourself to your feet, a strange heaviness pulls on your limbs, like someone’s wrapped you in a weighted blanket.</p>

<p><span class='inlandempire'>INLAND EMPIRE</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - Something has changed. Something is new.</p>

<p><span class='perceptionsight'>PERCEPTION (SIGHT)</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - You’re standing on a small island of bluish-grey stone, surrounded on all sides by a sheer drop into an impenetrable darkness. The sky above you is similarly pitch-black, yet despite the lack of sunlight or other illumination, you can see without hindrance.</p>

<p><span class='logic'>LOGIC</span> <span class='check'>[Trivial: Success]</span>  - This does not look like the inside of a closet.</p>

<p><span class='visualcalculus'>VISUAL CALCULUS</span> <span class='check'>[Challenging: Success]</span>  - Nor below it. Assuming this is an underground cavern, it must be incredibly vast for the walls to be out of sight entirely; you would know if a cavity of that size existed underneath the school, because the entire town would have collapsed into it long ago.</p>

<p><span class='you'>YOU</span> <span class='check'></span> - What am I wearing? [Look down.]</p>

KNIGHT'S ARMOR - Looking down at yourself, you immediately notice that your sweater and slacks have been swapped out for a very different outfit. Your limbs and vital areas are clad in a layer of segmented steel plates, while the remainder is obscured by a thick black bodysuit that flows comfortably across your skin. The ensemble is tied off at your neck by a bandana.

<p><span class='interfacing'>INTERFACING</span> <span class='check'>[Challenging: Success]</span>  - As you flex your fingers, a multitude of tiny scales shift and flow over each knuckle of the gauntlet. It’s far lighter than you’d expect from this quantity of metal, barely hindering your movements at all, and the whole assemblage gleams like it was forged yesterday. You may not be an expert on medieval equipment, but this is clearly high-quality stuff.</p>

<p><span class='savoirfaire'>SAVOIR FAIRE</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - Pretty snazzy ensemble you’ve found yourself in, Kris! You’d be the fashion statement of the century if you brought this to school – maybe even the millenium.</p>

<p><span class='perceptionsight'>PERCEPTION (SIGHT)</span> <span class='check'></span> - That’s not all that’s different, though. The bangs that fall into your vision are as dark as the void around you, and while the armour reveals very little, you can still see a few patches of skin showing through in a vibrant shade of cyan.</p>

<p><span class='endurance'>ENDURANCE</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - Congratulations. As if emulating jaundice symptoms wasn’t bad enough, you’ve somehow managed to find an even stranger skin tone than your usual.</p>

<p><span class='painthreshold'>PAIN THRESHOLD</span> <span class='check'>[Easy: Success]</span>  - You don’t seem injured, at least - that’s a relief, not to mention a miracle. By all rights, you should be at least somewhat bruised, and if you’d landed on your neck…</p>

<p><span class='encyclopedia'>ENCYCLOPEDIA</span> <span class='check'>[Godly: Failure]</span>  - The floor broke, and you fell. Everything else is blank. You don’t have the slightest idea why your appearance changed, how you got here, where Susie is…</p>

<p><span class='reactionspeed'>REACTION SPEED</span> <span class='check'>[Easy: Success]</span>  - Susie! She’s down here, too – and maybe in trouble. There’s no telling what kind of otherworldly dangers she might have run into.</p>

<p><span class='empathy'>EMPATHY</span> <span class='check'>[Easy: Success]</span>  - She may be unpleasant, but that doesn’t mean she deserves to die, especially not in such a cold and lonely place.</p>

<p><span class='espritdecorps'>ESPRIT DE CORPS</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - Besides which, there is safety in numbers, and she would make for a powerful ally. If you can convince her to set aside her grudge and join forces with you, your chances of survival are far higher than going solo.</p>

<p><span class='visualcalculus'>VISUAL CALCULUS</span> <span class='check'>[Easy: Success]</span>  - There’s only one path forward: a thin peninsula of stone connects this outcropping to the mainland, a patchwork assemblage of barren cliffs and narrow ledges fading into the dark.</p>

<p><span class='inlandempire'>INLAND EMPIRE</span> <span class='check'>[Formidable: Success]</span>  - Wait. There, by the edge of the path. Something is shining, can't you see?</p>

<p><span class='perceptionsight'>PERCEPTION (SIGHT)</span> <span class='check'>[Trivial: Success]</span>  - What are you talking about? There’s nothing here but bare rock.</p>

<p><span class='inlandempire'>INLAND EMPIRE</span> <span class='check'></span> - No, not like that. This is a light for the SOUL, not for the eyes.</p>

<p><span class='volition'>VOLITION</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - The Dreamer gets like this sometimes. You might as well go along with it, seeing as nothing else seems to make sense here.</p>

Alright, I’ll humour you. Where is this mysterious light, exactly?

I’m gonna say “doubt” to that one. Let’s keep moving.

<p><span class='you'>YOU</span> <span class='check'></span> - Alright, I'll humour you. Where is this mysterious light, exactly?</p>

<p><span class='inlandempire'>INLAND EMPIRE</span> <span class='check'></span> - About three paces to your left, a flickering gold sparkle hovers at waist height. It casts a strangely welcoming warmth onto your fingers - the comfort of returning home after a long journey, perhaps.</p>

<p><span class='painthreshold'>PAIN THRESHOLD</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - It sounds crazy, but you really do feel better. The lingering ache along your back from the locker incident fades, and within moments it’s like it was never there at all.</p>

<p><span class='empathy'>EMPATHY</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - You can feel a gentle touch reach in and brush the morning’s cobwebs from your mind, like your mother wiping stains from the corner of your mouth.</p>

<p><span class='volition'>VOLITION</span> <span class='check'></span> and ENDURANCE - In mind and body, you are made whole.</p>

<p><span class='electrochemistry'>ELECTROCHEMISTRY</span> <span class='check'></span> - Wow, that feels… amazing. Good call, Dreamer! Keep us posted if there’s any more of these sparkles in future.</p>

<p><span class='reactionspeed'>REACTION SPEED</span> <span class='check'>[Easy: Success]</span>  - In the meantime, we have a classmate to find. We’d best not stand around any longer.</p>

<p><span class='savoirfaire'>SAVOIR FAIRE</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - You set off, boots clanking against the soil. It doesn’t take long to find your stride: far from holding you back, the added bulk of your armour seems to enhance your momentum, pushing you forward into a steady, mile-eating march.</p>

<p><span class='physicalintrument'>PHYSICAL INTRUMENT</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - You’ve barely set off, and already the runner’s high is starting to creep in, limbs pumping and breath quickening. You should get out of the house more often, if this is what it’s like.</p>

<p><span class='volition'>VOLITION</span> <span class='check'>[Challenging: Success]</span>  - It isn’t usually, no; there’s a reason you stay inside so much, and it’s not the weather. Is this euphoria an aftereffect of the healing, or the product of another unseen transformation?</p>

<p><span class='vitreousnodes'>VITREOUS NODES</span> <span class='check'></span> - There are other islands, small spires of rock reaching upwards. Perched on each one is some kind of plant-like growth: a long, thin stem grows up from a wider base, before blooming out into a large ivory sphere. They react to your presence as you pass by, oscillating back and forth with an unearthly chittering noise.</p>

<p><span class='perceptionsight'>PERCEPTION (SIGHT)</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - The mainland draws near, and your lonely path merges with the cliff face to form a winding mountain trail. The wall beside you is marred with unsettling eye-shaped graffiti alongside various holes and pockmarks, some of which ooze a translucent, tarlike substance.</p>

<p><span class='logic'>LOGIC</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - It’s unclear whether this is a real mineral-oil product or simply a semi-solidified state of the omnipresent darkness. Either way, you probably shouldn’t touch it.</p>

<p><span class='reactionspeed'>REACTION SPEED</span> <span class='check'>[Formidable: Failure]</span>  - Was there something up there on the cliff? Whatever it was, it’s gone now.</p>

<p><span class='slipperyslope'>SLIPPERY SLOPE</span> <span class='check'></span> - The path’s been mostly flat so far, but this section has crumbled into a steep drop. Too steep to walk down - you’ll have to get down another way.</p>

<p><span class='perceptionsight'>PERCEPTION (SIGHT)</span> <span class='check'>[Easy: Success]</span>  - It seems that many others have had the same idea, as there’s a clear trajectory down the middle, worn smooth as if to invite you down.</p>

[Savoir Faire - Easy 8] Slide down.

Yeah, I’m not trying that. Let’s look for another way down.

<p><span class='check'>CHECK</span> <span class='check'></span> SUCCESS</p>

<p><span class='savoirfaire'>SAVOIR FAIRE</span> <span class='check'>[Easy: Success]</span>  - You settle yourself against the smoothed rut and, in a motion repeated in playgrounds the world over, give yourself a push. The air flies past as you descend, and before you know it, you've touched down at the bottom. Textbook execution, if I do say so myself.</p>

<p><span class='divergingpaths'>DIVERGING PATHS</span> <span class='check'></span> - Down here is much the same as up there, with one notable change: the path forks in two directions. One goes the same way you’ve been following so far, but the other diverts off to your right.</p>

Head forward.

Head right.

<p><span class='you'>YOU</span> <span class='check'></span> - Head right.</p>

<p><span class='rightpath'>RIGHT PATH</span> <span class='check'></span> - There doesn’t seem to be anything here. It’s just a disappointing dead end, cut short by another cliff.</p>

<p><span class='perceptionsight'>PERCEPTION (SIGHT)</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - At first glance, perhaps: but as you look closer, you spy a faint gleam, shining out of the rock.</p>

<p><span class='volition'>VOLITION</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - Unfortunately, the hole it’s shining out of also happens to be leaking the same tarry stuff you saw before. Puzzlehead already warned you about this -- don’t get that stuff on your hands if you can help it.</p>

Okay, okay. [Return to the main path.]

<p><span class='check'>CHECK</span> <span class='check'></span> SUCCESS</p>

<p><span class='handeyecoordination'>HAND/EYE COORDINATION</span> <span class='check'>[Easy: Success]</span>  - There’s enough of the shiny whatever-it-is sticking up out of the grime that you might be able to dredge it up without getting your gauntlet too sticky. Careful, careful… Gotcha!</p>

<p><span class='volition'>VOLITION</span> <span class='check'></span> - Why do I even bother?</p>

<p><span class='shiningobject'>SHINING OBJECT</span> <span class='check'></span> - Now that you can inspect it more closely, the mysterious object is revealed to be a small, oblong shard of crystal. It glows faintly with an inner light.</p>

<p><span class='logic'>LOGIC</span> <span class='check'>[Legendary: Failure]</span>  - This clearly isn’t an ordinary piece of glass, but neither is it any other material you’ve heard of. What kind of gemstone glows by itself?</p>

<p><span class='savoirfaire'>SAVOIR FAIRE</span> <span class='check'>[Challenging: Success]</span>  - More importantly, what kind of price will it fetch on the free market? This is a huge score, Kris! You’d best hold on tight to a find like this.</p>

<p><span class='encyclopedia'>ENCYCLOPEDIA</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - Radioactive particles can interact with certain transparent materials to produce a distinctive blue glow, known as Cherenkov radiation.</p>

<p><span class='endurance'>ENDURANCE</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - Radiation?! Drop it, *now*! The cereal was bad enough - we’re not holding onto some kind of cursed death-rock because the Acrobat wanted to make a quick buck!</p>

<p><span class='conceptualization'>CONCEPTUALIZATION</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - I wouldn't be so concerned; this is more of a warm yellow than the blueish shade Pillar-Bookhead was talking about. In fact, it reminds me more of that sparkle from earlier. What do you say, Dreamer?</p>

<p><span class='inlandempire'>INLAND EMPIRE</span> <span class='check'>[Challenging: Success]</span>  - It’s no octarine, but this homely hue may well be the colour of magic. Perhaps you could ask the wizard when you find him? In any case, this little glimmer is nothing to be scared of.</p>

<p><span class='driftingfluff'>DRIFTING FLUFF</span> <span class='check'></span> - As you make your way back to the main thoroughfare, a new feature of the landscape catches your eye: a huge pile of dust has gathered by the wayside, rising taller than your head.</p>

<p><span class='perceptionhearing'>PERCEPTION (HEARING)</span> <span class='check'>[Medium:Success]</span>  - As it shifts and settles in the breeze, a soft susurration of ambient noise emits from its depths.</p>

<p><span class='halflight'>HALF LIGHT</span> <span class='check'></span> - Dust? Surely not…</p>

<p><span class='logic'>LOGIC</span> <span class='check'>[Easy: Success]</span>  - Thankfully, no. Monster dust has a very distinct colour and texture. This is probably just an assortment of various particulates -- mainly clothing fibres and shed skin flakes, if I’m not mistaken.</p>

<p><span class='volition'>VOLITION</span> <span class='check'>[Easy: Success]</span>  - That's a relief; this situation is creepy enough without being outright morbid. Small mercies, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class='vitreousnodes'>VITREOUS NODES</span> <span class='check'></span> - There’s a few more of those globes here, though these are black instead of white. When you walk past, they start swaying like the others - but their motion is far more violent, dislodging a handful of white seedpods to fly in your direction.</p>

<p><span class='handeyecoordination'>HAND/EYE COORDINATION</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - Their trajectories seem to follow a set pattern of threes, spaced out thirty degrees to either side. It shouldn’t be too hard to slip between one and the next.</p>

<p><span class='logic'>LOGIC</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - I’m not sure you even need to bother. They’re slow enough that you could easily outrun them entirely - so slow, in fact, that they seem to hang in the air in clear defiance of gravity. Would an impact even hurt at this velocity?</p>

<p><span class='halflight'>HALF LIGHT</span> <span class='check'>[Challenging: Success]</span>  - Don’t let it fool you. These things emanate a bubbling vitriol that promises pain if you let them near.</p>

<p><span class='visualcalculus'>VISUAL CALCULUS</span> <span class='check'>[Trivial: Success]</span>  - Don’t pat yourself on the back too soon.

<p><span class='you'>YOU</span> <span class='check'></span> - Look around for another path.</p>

<p><span class='strangepicture'>STRANGE PICTURE</span> <span class='check'></span> - To your left, the cliff face is adorned by more of those creepy eye paintings. These ones have a little more to them, though: each eye is underscored with a line of three dots, and below each of those, a small piece of rock sticks out conspicuously.</p>

<p><span class='conceptualization'>CONCEPTUALIZATION</span> <span class='check'>[Legendary: Failure]</span>  - What is this, some kind of mural? If it is, the artistic significance is lost on you.</p>

<p><span class='logic'>LOGIC</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - It seems too regular, too *purposed* to be simply decorative - a set of instructions, perhaps, or a story.</p>

<p><span class='reactionspeed'>REACTION SPEED</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - There’s something written on that pillar next to the healing place. It’s almost the same colour as the stone behind -- you must have missed it in the rush of renewal.</p>

<p><span class='plaque'>PLAQUE</span> <span class='check'></span> - A metal plaque is bolted to the stone. Engraved onto it is a message: “In this land, only eyes blinded by darkness can see the way…”</p>

<p><span class='logic'>LOGIC</span> <span class='check'>[Formidable: Failure]</span>  - A cryptic statement, if ever there were. It seems to be hinting at a way to progress, and it almost certainly relates to that arrangement of eyes and dots, but what could “blinded by darkness” mean?</p>

<p><span class='stonedivots'>STONE DIVOTS</span> <span class='check'></span> - A tiny nodule of stone sticks out from the rock below each set of dots, as thick as your pinky finger. The crack between them and the surrounding rock is thin, but deeper than you can see.</p>

<p><span class='interfacing'>INTERFACING</span> <span class='check'>[Challenging: Success]</span>  - As you run your fingers over the nubbin, you feel it give slightly. You push into it, overcoming a little resistance, and it sinks in with a click before popping back out to the original position. It’s… a push-button? Is this all some kind of mechanism?</p>

<p><span class='paintedeyes'>PAINTED EYES</span> <span class='check'></span> - The upper outline of the first and third eye wavers for a moment, then bleeds down into their interior, rendering each one blank and dark.</p>

<p><span class='logic'>LOGIC</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - Ignoring the anomalous paint behaviour for a moment, only the first and third eyes responded, which correlates to the closed dots in the pattern. You’ve seen things like this before – it’s a lights-out puzzle.</p>

<p><span class='savoirfaire'>SAVOIR FAIRE</span> <span class='check'>[Easy: Success]</span>  - There’s another slide here, which you navigate with just as little issue as the first. It’s almost kind of fun!</p>

<p><span class='perceptiontouch'>PERCEPTION (TOUCH)</span> <span class='check'></span> - This plateau is dotted with several mounds of dust. As you lay a hand on one to discern its texture, the upper half of the pile loses coherence and flies apart, dispersing into the wind to reveal a large boulder underneath.</p>

<p><span class='conceptualization'>CONCEPTUALIZATION</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - You can picture how this happens: stray fibres and debris are blown here by the wind and catch on the nearest obstacle, gathering over time like a snowdrift, or perhaps in the way that droplets of rain nucleate around airborne particles.</p>

<p><span class='reactionspeed'>REACTION SPEED</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - Hold on a second, something just ran out from behind that pile you smashed. It’s hiding behind that one now.</p>

<p><span class='halflight'>HALF LIGHT</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - An ambush? Not on my watch. Tear these things asunder - give them nowhere to hide from you!</p>

<p><span class='shadowyfigure'>SHADOWY FIGURE</span> <span class='check'></span> - As you run from pile to pile, slashing your hand through each potential hiding place, your quarry ducks away just as desperately, until there is only one dust pile left.</p>

??? - “H-hey, back off! Come any closer and I'll… I’ll bite your face off!”

<p><span class='rhetoric'>RHETORIC</span> <span class='check'>[Easy: Success]</span>  - That threat sounds very familiar. Twice in one day - what are the chances?</p>

<p><span class='inlandempire'>INLAND EMPIRE</span> <span class='check'>[Challenging: Success]</span>  - Higher than you may think. This is not the first time, nor will it be the last before the sun sets on our journey.</p>

<p><span class='perceptionsight'>PERCEPTION (SIGHT)</span> <span class='check'>[Formidable: Failure]</span>  - It’s no coincidence: the final drift blows apart to reveal an all-too familiar muzzle. Susie looks to have gone through a similar change to your own, but you’re too overcome by relief and nerves to process the details right now.</p>

Task complete: Find Susie

<p><span class='empathy'>EMPATHY</span> <span class='check'>[Medium: Success]</span>  - Huh. I suppose face biting is just her default response to being threatened.</p>

<p><span class='rhetoric'>RHETORIC</span> <span class='check'></span> - Oh, really? I never would have guessed.</p></body>
