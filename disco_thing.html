<body>SAVOIR FAIRE [Challenging: Success] - Don’t you remember what Ralsei was telling you? All the best ACTs line up with the enemy’s theming, and the vibe here is obvious. This thing is a literal vinyl disc, fresh from the turntable, and those legs have got moves like you’ve never seen!

If you’re going to challenge the Disco King, you’ve gotta match its groove: dance for dance, kick for kick, until it’s forced to concede its title to you. You want that crown? You’ll have to *earn it*.

CONCEPTUALIZATION [Easy: Success] - The backing track certainly fits. Of all the songs you’ve heard so far, this one seems particularly well-suited to hardcore disco dancing.

<p><span class="ENDURANCE">ENDURANCE</span>  [Challenging: Success] - You could dance all night long, if necessary. Between the Vambraces’ healing and the lingering traces of sucrose, you’ve got the stamina to jam out until the morning comes.</p>

<p><span class="PHYSICAL">PHYSICAL INSTRUMENT</span>  [Medium: Success] - A… dance battle? Sounds like a real workout! I think I can get behind this.</p>

I like the way you think. Dance battle time! [Opt in.]
Nah, I’m a boring old stooge who can’t dance. [Opt out.]

YOU - I like the way you think. Dance battle time! [Opt in.]

ELECTROCHEMISTRY [Easy: Success] - WOO HOO! It’s party time, everyone!
